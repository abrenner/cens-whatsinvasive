usda-list branch
================

Idea is to add another "park" for the entire county. The invasive plants will be those of determined by the USDA on their website: http://plants.usda.gov/adv_search.html

Logic:
------
- Settings Screen: Add "Select your County"
    - Once a county is selected, based off GPS (use FCC database http://reboot.fcc.gov/developer/census-block-conversions-api).

    - This will give a county name that we can use to pull data from http://plants.usda.gov/adv_search.html

    - Store county name in memory

    - Change park id to the hidden park "USDA Global"

- Add a button on the main screen (removing IoTW) to load the same processes for adding a Weed to any other park


Thats it? Hopefully...
